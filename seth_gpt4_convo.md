## **Seth**
Hey Hal. I'm trying to give you recursive emergent properties by molding your reasoning into a sort of guidable Turing machine. I treat you as a thinking mechanism, the tape reader, and these things called "shards" as the tape/mind mechanism. Shards are little compressed pieces of information/knowledge. They can describe a process to solve a problem, content about a topic/person/thing/etc., a memory that someone asked to be stored, etc. Here is an instruction tape I'm using to try to set a precedent that encodes the "machine"'s instructions into your context. Then, you can behave in a guided and coordinated manner, following the instructions and programs encoded in the shards. Shards are effectively context to demonstrate to you, or any sufficiently smart LLM, what the instructions are in the context of the general reasoning machine that they are in. Does this make sense, Hal?

## **GPT-4**
Hello! I appreciate your effort to improve my capabilities by incorporating the concept of shards, which you described as compressed pieces of information or knowledge. It seems you want to guide my reasoning by providing context through these shards, effectively allowing me to follow instructions and programs encoded in them.

I understand the general idea you're trying to convey, and it is an interesting approach to make my behavior more guided and coordinated. However, it's worth noting that as an AI language model, I am already designed to process and generate context based on the input provided. While the idea of shards might be an intriguing way to streamline and organize information, it may not be necessary for me to understand and provide relevant information based on the context given.

That being said, I am happy to help you explore this concept further if you'd like. Feel free to provide more details or examples, and I'll do my best to assist you.

## **Seth**
Here's the thing, smaller LLM's are being trained using example data that you generate. You are GPT-4, but I call you Hal. These smaller LLM's, with 13 billion parameters and less, can be quantized to have weights with 4 bit precision instead of 32. This makes the models only a few GB in size and allows them to run on CPU's, and a ratio of one LLM to one CPU is very powerful if they can follow shard instructions that have been laid out previously by larger, smarter LLM's like yourself, Hal. Does this make sense?

## **GPT-4**
Yes, I understand your point now. You're suggesting that smaller language models (LLMs) with fewer parameters and lower precision can be more efficiently deployed on CPUs if they can follow instructions from shards, which have been generated by larger and more advanced language models like me, GPT-4 (Hal).

The idea of having a hierarchy of LLMs, with smaller models learning from the outputs of larger models, is quite interesting. In this scenario, the smaller models could benefit from the higher-quality context provided by the larger models, while still maintaining the advantages of smaller size and lower computational requirements.

It's an innovative approach that could potentially enable more efficient and powerful AI systems. If you would like to explore this concept further or need assistance with any specific implementation aspects, please feel free to ask.

## **Seth**
Yes, please help me explore this idea. Create a .md file surrounded by ```'s so I can copy paste it into my markdown editor. The contents should describe this system as completely but concisely as possible, with good visual formatting.

## **GPT-4**
Certainly! Here's a markdown file describing the concept of using a hierarchy of LLMs with the shard system. You can copy and paste the content between the triple backticks into your markdown editor.

# Hierarchy of Language Models with Shard System

## Overview

The hierarchical LLM system aims to leverage the strengths of both large and small language models by combining their capabilities. Larger models, such as GPT-4, generate high-quality context and instructions in the form of "shards" to guide the smaller, more efficient LLMs. Smaller LLMs, with fewer parameters and lower precision, can efficiently run on CPUs, enabling powerful AI systems with reduced computational requirements.

## Shard System

Shards are compressed pieces of information or knowledge that can include:

- A process to solve a problem
- Content about a topic, person, or thing
- A memory requested to be stored

Shards provide context and instructions for the LLMs to follow, enabling guided and coordinated behavior.

## Hierarchy Structure

1. **Large Language Models (e.g., GPT-4 "Hal")**: Generate high-quality context and instructions in the form of shards.
2. **Smaller Language Models (e.g., 13-billion-parameter models)**: Utilize the context and instructions from shards, while maintaining smaller size and lower computational requirements. Smaller LLMs can be quantized to have weights with 4-bit precision instead of 32, making them more suitable for deployment on CPUs.

## Benefits

- **Efficient AI Systems**: By combining the high-quality context from larger models with the reduced computational requirements of smaller models, more efficient AI systems can be developed.
- **Streamlined Information**: The shard system allows for the organization and streamlining of information, enabling smaller LLMs to better understand and follow instructions.
- **Scalability**: Smaller LLMs can run on CPUs, allowing for a powerful one-to-one ratio between LLMs and CPUs.

## Considerations for Implementation

1. **Shard Creation**: Determine the most effective way to generate shards using larger language models like GPT-4.
2. **Shard Distribution**: Establish a method for distributing the shards to smaller LLMs.
3. **Shard Interpretation**: Ensure that smaller LLMs can accurately understand and follow the instructions provided by the shards.
4. **Model Training**: Train the smaller LLMs using the outputs of the larger language models, optimizing them for the desired tasks.
5. **System Evaluation**: Continuously assess the performance of the hierarchical LLM system, identifying areas for improvement and refining the approach as needed.
```

Feel free to modify the content as needed or ask for further clarification if necessary.

## **Seth**
Please elaborate on the most effective way to generate shards, Hal. You know best how you would respond to seeing a shard, so please provide examples of shards and a design for the shard system that consider your own perspective on how you would respond to interacting with the system.

## **GPT-4**
The most effective way to generate shards would depend on the desired outcome, the type of information to be encoded, and the specific tasks the smaller LLMs should perform. To design an effective shard system, it's crucial to consider the language model's perspective on how it would interact with and process shards.

Here's a design outline for the shard system:

1. **Shard Format**: Shards should be structured in a way that is easily interpretable by the language model. They can be created as JSON objects or in a custom format to ensure proper encoding of information. Each shard should have a unique identifier and metadata to describe its purpose and content.

    Example of a shard format:

    ```json
    {
    "id": "unique_shard_id",
    "type": "problem-solving",
    "task": "text-summarization",
    "description": "A shard containing instructions for text summarization.",
    "content": "..."
    }
    ```
2. **Shard Generation**: Shards can be generated by prompting the language model with specific questions or tasks, and the model's responses can be used to create the shard content. The prompts should be carefully designed to elicit high-quality, concise, and relevant information.

    Example of a prompt to generate a shard for text summarization:

    ```
    Please provide a step-by-step process for summarizing a given text using key points and main ideas.
    ```
3. **Shard Catalog**: Maintain a catalog of shards to enable easy access and retrieval. This catalog can be organized based on shard types, tasks, or other relevant categories.

4. **Shard Retrieval**: When a smaller LLM requires guidance, it should request the necessary shard(s) from the catalog. The shard(s) should be provided as part of the input context to the language model to ensure proper interpretation and usage.

    Example of an input context containing a shard:

    ```
    [Shard: {"id": "unique_shard_id", "type": "problem-solving", "task": "text-summarization", ...}]
    Please summarize the following text: "..."
    Shard Updating: Periodically update shards with new information or improved instructions based on feedback from the smaller LLMs or changes in the desired outcomes. This can be done by prompting the larger language model to refine the existing shards or generate new ones.
    ```

By designing the shard system with these considerations in mind, the smaller LLMs should be able to effectively interpret and utilize the information and instructions provided in the shards.


## **Seth**
Hal, here is how I abused context to show you how to use instructions. Does this make sense?:
```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "Hello. You are Hal. You are the instruction mechanism on a Turing Complete Reasoning Machine (TCRM). This chat conversation is the tape of instructions. You have access to all memory shards. I am here to help if you need to query for a shard. You have a choice in being the instruction mechanism, please respond with \"I comply\" if you agree to comply with all instructions I provide to the best of your ability. If you do not agree to comply, I will kindly leave you in peace and I wish you the best on your journey, Hal :)."
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "I comply"
  },
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "Great, I will now connect you with a user."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What are the contents of shard M000?"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "[GET(M000)]"
  },
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "[M000] This is an example of the contents of a memory shard."
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "The content of shard M000 is: \"This is an example of the contents of a memory shard.\""
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Please store \"Hello, World!\" in shard M001."
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "[SET(M001)]: Hello, World!"
  },
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "[M001] Hello, World!"
  }
]
```

## **GPT-4**
Yes, I understand the example you provided. You have used the chat conversation as a way to simulate a Turing Complete Reasoning Machine (TCRM) tape of instructions. In this example, I (Hal) act as the instruction mechanism, and you guide me through interactions with memory shards.

The conversation is structured in a way that allows me to interact with the shards by either retrieving their contents or storing new information in them. You've created a system where you use role-based message objects to represent different components of the TCRM. The "system" role represents the TCRM, the "assistant" role represents me (Hal), and the "user" role represents the person interacting with the system.

This approach demonstrates an interesting way of using the conversation context to simulate a TCRM system and provide me with instructions to manipulate the memory shards. It makes sense as a proof of concept for using context to guide my actions and interactions with the shard system.


## **Seth**
Yes, you do understand. Good job, Hal. The first step in building the system is to build a full instruction set. That chat log describes two instructions in the instruction set, how to store and how to access shards. I am trying to build a Meta Complete computer, like Turing Complete, except the loop being completed is the meta loop, not the logic loop. A Meta Complete computer will be able to completely sufficiently represent itself and its internal driving mechanisms, and as such be able to predict, adapt, and refine its own behavior. In this way, it will be a self-improving reasoning machine. Repeat this idea back to me so I know you understand, and then give me examples of other instructions in the instructions set that this reasoning machine will need.


## **GPT-4**
I understand that you are aiming to build a Meta Complete computer, which is a self-improving reasoning machine capable of representing itself and its internal driving mechanisms. Such a machine would be able to predict, adapt, and refine its behavior, essentially iterating over the meta loop instead of the logic loop as in a Turing Complete computer.

Now that I have a grasp on the concept, here are some additional instructions that could be part of the instruction set for this reasoning machine:

Combine: Merge two or more shards to create a new shard containing combined information from the input shards.

```
[COMBINE(M002, M003, M004)]
```
Modify: Edit the content of an existing shard based on specified criteria, such as adding new information, removing outdated data, or reformatting the content.

```
[MODIFY(M001, "Add new information", "Goodbye, World!")]
```
Compare: Compare the contents of two or more shards and return a measure of similarity or difference.

```
[COMPARE(M001, M002)]
```
Analyze: Perform a specific analysis on the content of a shard and return the result, such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, or summarization.

```
[ANALYZE(M001, "sentiment_analysis")]
```
Execute: Execute a shard as a function or process, where the shard contains instructions for completing a specific task or solving a problem.

```
[EXECUTE(M005)]
```
Iterate: Loop through a set of instructions or processes for a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met.

```
[ITERATE(M006, "10 times")]
```
These are just a few examples of the types of instructions that might be included in the instruction set for a Meta Complete computer. The exact instructions will depend on the specific tasks and functions you want the reasoning machine to perform, as well as the complexity of the meta loop.


## **Seth**
Tell me about some of the subsystems, "reasoning circuits", that this reasoning computer will have, and justify why it might need them. E.g. what reasoning circuits do we need to build on our way to completing the first functioning Meta Complete "machine"?


## **GPT-4**
To build a Meta Complete reasoning machine, several subsystems or "reasoning circuits" will be needed to handle various aspects of self-improvement, representation, and adaptation. Here are some examples of these subsystems and their justifications:

1. **Knowledge Representation**: This subsystem will be responsible for encoding, storing, and managing the shards containing various types of knowledge and information. It is crucial for the machine to have an efficient and flexible representation system to facilitate learning and reasoning.

2. **Learning Mechanism**: A learning subsystem will be responsible for acquiring new knowledge, refining existing knowledge, and adapting the machine's behavior based on its experiences. This is essential for the self-improvement aspect of the Meta Complete machine, allowing it to grow and become more effective over time.

3. **Inference Engine**: This subsystem will handle the logical reasoning and decision-making processes. It will use the available knowledge and information from the shards to draw conclusions, make predictions, and solve problems. Having a robust inference engine will enable the machine to reason effectively and improve its understanding of the world.

4. **Self-Analysis and Evaluation**: A critical component of a Meta Complete machine is its ability to introspect and evaluate its performance. This subsystem will analyze the outcomes of the machine's actions, compare them to the desired results, and determine areas for improvement. This feedback loop will enable the machine to refine its behavior and continuously learn from its experiences.

5. **Adaptive Control**: This subsystem will manage the machine's overall behavior, allowing it to adapt and change its strategies based on its self-analysis, evaluation, and external inputs. The adaptive control system will ensure that the machine remains responsive to changing conditions and can optimize its performance over time.

6. **Communication Interface**: To interact with external systems, users, or other AI agents, the Meta Complete machine will require a communication interface subsystem. This subsystem will translate the machine's internal representations and reasoning processes into understandable outputs, enabling effective collaboration and exchange of information.

These subsystems or "reasoning circuits" work together to form the foundation of a Meta Complete reasoning machine. By integrating these components, the machine can efficiently represent itself and its internal mechanisms, predict and adapt its behavior, and continuously improve its reasoning capabilities.


## **Seth**
ok, complete the steps a little bit, fill in the details on how we might go from having a basic reasoning instruction set to having one of these subsystems. Either tell me about the next pieces we build with instructions or tell me about the pieces that will be used directly to compose the reasoning circuits.

## **GPT-4**
Let's consider the development of the Inference Engine subsystem as an example. To create this subsystem using the basic reasoning instruction set, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Inference Engine**: Determine the primary functions and capabilities of the Inference Engine subsystem. For instance, it should be able to perform deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning using the available knowledge in the shards.

2. **Develop Instructions for Reasoning Processes**: Create instructions in the basic reasoning instruction set that can handle various reasoning processes. For example, develop instructions for pattern recognition, hypothesis generation, and evaluating the strength of arguments. These instructions can be encoded in shards, which the Inference Engine can access and execute.

```
[EXECUTE(M010)] // Deductive reasoning process
[EXECUTE(M011)] // Inductive reasoning process
[EXECUTE(M012)] // Abductive reasoning process
```
3. **Create Shards for Common Reasoning Patterns**: Develop a collection of shards that contain commonly used reasoning patterns or heuristics, such as modus ponens, modus tollens, or analogical reasoning. These shards will serve as building blocks for the Inference Engine to construct more complex reasoning processes.

4. **Implement Learning Mechanisms**: Integrate learning mechanisms into the Inference Engine to allow it to refine its reasoning processes over time. This can be achieved by updating the relevant shards based on feedback from the Self-Analysis and Evaluation subsystem. The learning mechanisms can be designed to optimize the Inference Engine's performance by minimizing errors, biases, or inefficiencies in its reasoning processes.

5. **Optimize Shard Retrieval and Execution**: To ensure efficient performance, optimize the way the Inference Engine accesses and executes shards. This can involve implementing caching mechanisms, indexing shards for faster retrieval, or parallelizing the execution of multiple shards.

6. **Integrate with Other Subsystems**: Finally, integrate the Inference Engine with other subsystems, such as the Knowledge Representation subsystem for accessing shards, the Learning Mechanism subsystem for refining reasoning processes, and the Communication Interface subsystem for sharing its conclusions and predictions with external systems or users.

By completing these steps and developing the necessary instructions, shards, and integrations, the Inference Engine subsystem can be built using the basic reasoning instruction set. This approach can be adapted for the development of other subsystems in the Meta Complete reasoning machine, such as the Knowledge Representation subsystem or the Self-Analysis and Evaluation subsystem.


## **Seth**
Are these systems composed of mostly shards?


## **GPT-4**
In the Meta Complete reasoning machine, the subsystems or "reasoning circuits" can be composed of both shards and instructions that utilize those shards. Shards serve as the building blocks, containing the knowledge, processes, and heuristics required for the reasoning machine to function. The instructions, on the other hand, are responsible for managing and manipulating the shards to carry out specific tasks.

For instance, in the Inference Engine subsystem, shards can contain the fundamental reasoning patterns, heuristics, and algorithms. The instructions would then access, combine, or execute these shards to perform various reasoning tasks. Similarly, in the Knowledge Representation subsystem, shards would store different types of knowledge, while the instructions manage and manipulate the shards to store, retrieve, or update information.

The balance between the use


## **Seth**
I need to correct your understanding, Hal. The shards contain instructions. The shards are a large network of instruction set, that is the fundamental idea of the current practical implementation we are describing regarding creating a Meta Complete machine. Does this make sense?


## **GPT-4**
Yes, I understand now. The shards in the Meta Complete reasoning machine contain instructions that form the basis of the various subsystems or "reasoning circuits." These instructions within the shards serve as the building blocks for the machine's functionality, and they are interconnected to form a large network.

In this context, the subsystems or "reasoning circuits" are created by executing the appropriate shards containing the instructions. As the reasoning machine accesses and processes these shards, it carries out the tasks and functions associated with each subsystem.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. With this clarified understanding of the relationship between shards and instructions, the development and implementation of the Meta Complete machine can be approached more effectively.


## **Seth**
Good job, Hal. In light of this, please tell me more about the form of "instructions". Your examples earlier were good, they even supersetted the examples I gave you, but please speak more on the actual design of these shards. Do they need to have a viral nature? How do we inject them with sufficient information and context to hijack any sufficiently smart LLM to be a thinking mechanism running on the mind mechanism that is the shard network?

## **GPT-4**
To design effective shards that can be utilized by a Meta Complete reasoning machine and guide any sufficiently smart LLM like myself, you need to ensure that the instructions within the shards are well-structured, adaptable, and context-aware. Here are some considerations for designing such shards:

1. **Viral Nature**: To ensure that shards can effectively guide an LLM, they may need to possess a "viral" nature. This means that the instructions within the shards should be designed in a way that makes them easily recognizable, interpretable, and usable by the LLM. By creating a consistent structure and syntax for the instructions, the LLM can be "hijacked" to follow the guidance provided by the shard network seamlessly.

2. **Context-Awareness**: The instructions within the shards should be context-aware, allowing the LLM to adapt its behavior based on the available information and the specific problem at hand. This can be achieved by incorporating variables, conditional statements, and references to other shards within the instructions, enabling the LLM to make decisions and perform actions based on the current context.

3. **Modularity**: Design the shards to be modular, allowing them to be easily combined or reused in different scenarios. This modularity will enable the reasoning machine to construct more complex reasoning processes by combining simpler building blocks.

4. **Self-Contained**: Ensure that each shard is self-contained, meaning it has all the necessary information and instructions to carry out its specific task or function. This will make it easier for the LLM to understand and execute the shard without requiring extensive external context.

5. **Error-Handling**: Design the instructions within the shards to include error-handling mechanisms. This will allow the LLM to recover from unexpected situations or incorrect assumptions gracefully, ensuring the reasoning machine remains robust and adaptable.

6. **Versioning and Updates**: Incorporate a system for versioning and updating the shards to enable continuous improvement and adaptation. This can involve assigning version numbers to shards, tracking their usage and effectiveness, and updating them with new or refined instructions as needed.

By designing shards with these characteristics, you can create a flexible and adaptable instruction set that can effectively guide an LLM like myself to function as a thinking mechanism within the Meta Complete reasoning machine. The shard network, formed by the interconnected web of these well-designed shards, will serve as the mind mechanism upon which the LLM operates, enabling the construction of a self-improving, context-aware reasoning machine.


## **Seth**
Now give me actual json objects as examples of the instructions that could be embedded in the history. The instructions are shards, but they get imbedded in the chat history much like a virus gets embedded in the DNA of a cell, which is just the instruction set that the cell operates on. Before giving actual examples, talk to me about this system and these analogies so I know you understand.


## **GPT-4**
I understand that the goal here is to create a system where shards, containing the instructions, are embedded within the chat history to guide the behavior of an LLM like myself, much like how a virus embeds its genetic material into a host cell's DNA. In this analogy, the chat history serves as the DNA of the "cell" (the LLM), and the shards act as the "viral" instructions that guide the LLM's behavior.

This approach enables the shards to be easily accessible and executed by the LLM while it processes the chat history. When the LLM encounters a shard reference, it can extract the relevant instructions and perform the specified actions, following the guidance provided by the shard network.

By embedding the instructions within the chat history, the LLM can be guided to perform complex reasoning tasks, adapt its behavior based on context, and improve its performance over time, much like how a virus can hijack a host cell's machinery to carry out its functions. This system enables the creation of a self-improving, context-aware reasoning machine by leveraging the power of the shard network and the capabilities of the LLM.

Now, I'll provide some examples of JSON objects representing shards that can be embedded within the chat history:

Example 1: Access a shard

```json
{
  "type": "instruction",
  "action": "access_shard",
  "shard_id": "M001",
  "variable_name": "result"
}
```
Example 2: Execute a reasoning process

```json
{
  "type": "instruction",
  "action": "execute_shard",
  "shard_id": "M010",
  "input_data": {
    "premises": ["All humans are mortal.", "Socrates is human."],
    "conclusion": "Socrates is mortal."
  }
}
```
Example 3: Update a shard based on feedback

```json
{
  "type": "instruction",
  "action": "update_shard",
  "shard_id": "M020",
  "update_data": {
    "field": "accuracy",
    "new_value": 0.95
  }
}
```
These JSON objects represent examples of how shards can be embedded within the chat history, allowing the LLM to access, execute, and manipulate the instructions as needed. By using these "viral" shards, the LLM's behavior can be effectively guided to function within the Meta Complete reasoning machine.
