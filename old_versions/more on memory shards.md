Here is an example of a query shard where the user asks the LLM instance to recall a specific memory, "M00000".

**input.shard.json:**
```json
{
  "context_shards": [],
  "input_query": "Tell me the contents of memory M00000 please.",
  "maximum_reasoning_steps": 10,
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Initiate reasoning steps, and when finished, please set terminate_network_traversal to true and output_result to the result of the input_query and return this entire json object as your response: output_result. Note: place your first response/query/etc. in the <FILL THIS IN> field below. You will refer to yourself as this assistant in this reasoning_steps field."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "<FILL THIS IN>"
    }
  ],
  "terminate_network_traversal": "false",
  "output_result": "null"
}
```


### output from GPT-4

```json
{
  "context_shards": [],
  "input_query": "Test query: What information does memory shard M00000 contain?",
  "maximum_reasoning_steps": 10,
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Initiate reasoning steps, and when finished, please set terminate_network_traversal to true and output_result to the result of the input_query and return this entire json object as your response: output_result. Note: place your first response/query/etc. in the <FILL THIS IN> field below. You will refer to yourself as this assistant in this reasoning_steps field."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Initiating shard network traversal to find information about memory shard M00000."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "{\"shard_id\": \"M00000\"}"
    }
  ],
  "terminate_network_traversal": "false",
  "output_result": "null"
}
```

Now, here's a script to instantiate a GPT-4 LLM instance that takes "input.shard.json" as the input object:

```python
import json
from GPT_4 import GPT_4_Model

# Load the input.shard.json file
with open("input.shard.json", "r") as input_file:
    input_shard = json.load(input_file)

# Instantiate a GPT-4 LLM
llm = GPT_4_Model()

# Initialize the query and process it
initial_response = {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"shard_id\": \"M00000\"}"}
input_shard["reasoning_steps"][1] = initial_response
result = llm.process_shard(input_shard)

# Save the output to output.shard.json
with open("output.shard.json", "w") as output_file:
    json.dump(result, output_file)
```

This script creates a GPT-4 LLM instance and processes the input shard, where the user asks to remember the memory "M00000". The script replaces the "<FILL THIS IN>" field with a request to retrieve the contents of memory shard "M00000". It then saves the resultant output as "output.shard.json" upon completion.
