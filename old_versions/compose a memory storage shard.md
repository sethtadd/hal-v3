Here's a complimentary shard, SRD-000003, which describes how to store a memory:

```json
{
  "shard_id": "SRD-000003",
  "instructions": [
    {
      "title": "Assess Memory Importance",
      "description": "Evaluate the significance of the new memory and decide whether it should be stored."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create Memory Shard",
      "description": "If the memory is deemed important, compose a new shard with relevant metadata and content."
    },
    {
      "title": "Assign Shard ID",
      "description": "Assign a unique shard_id to the new memory shard."
    },
    {
      "title": "Integrate Memory Shard",
      "description": "Integrate the new memory shard into the shard network, considering its connections to existing shards."
    },
    {
      "title": "Update Shard Network",
      "description": "Update the shard network to include the memory shard, ensuring efficient navigation and retrieval by LLMs."
    }
  ],
  "example_memory_integration": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": {
      "shard_id": "SRD-YYYYYY",
      "shard_type": "Memory",
      "topic": "Sample Memory",
      "metadata": {
        "created_at": "2023-04-03T12:00:00Z",
        "version": 1
      },
      "content": "This is an example of a memory shard that has been created and integrated into the shard network."
    }
  }
}
```

This shard provides instructions on storing a memory, including assessing the memory's importance, creating a new memory shard with a unique ID, and integrating the memory shard into the shard network. The example_memory_integration field demonstrates an example of a memory shard that has been successfully created and integrated.

## REVISED

Apologies for the oversight. Here's the revised complimentary shard, SRD-000003, which includes an example similar to the last one and provides a stronger indication for memory storage intent:

```json
{
  "shard_id": "SRD-000003",
  "instructions": [
    {
      "title": "Assess Memory Importance",
      "description": "Evaluate the significance of the new memory and decide whether it should be stored."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create Memory Shard",
      "description": "If the memory is deemed important, compose a new shard with relevant metadata and content."
    },
    {
      "title": "Assign Shard ID",
      "description": "Assign a unique shard_id to the new memory shard."
    },
    {
      "title": "Integrate Memory Shard",
      "description": "Integrate the new memory shard into the shard network, considering its connections to existing shards."
    },
    {
      "title": "Update Shard Network And Store",
      "description": "Update the shard network to include the memory shard, ensuring efficient navigation and retrieval by LLMs."
    }
  ],
  "example_reasoning_step_storage_intent": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": {
      "action": "store_memory",
      "memory_shard": {
        "shard_id": "SRD-YYYYYY",
        "shard_type": "Memory",
        "topic": "Sample Memory",
        "metadata": {
          "created_at": "2023-04-03T12:00:00Z",
          "version": 1
        },
        "content": "This is an example of a memory shard that has been created and integrated into the shard network."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this updated version, the "Update Shard Network And Store" instruction is more explicit, and the example_reasoning_step_storage_intent field demonstrates how the memory storage intent can be better expressed with an "action" field. This should make it easier for an LLM or regex script to extract the intent to store the memory.


## EXAMPLE MEMORY STORAGE QUERY SHARD

Here's an example of a shard that would induce a memoryless version of me to store a shard:

```json
{
  "context_shards": [],
  "input_query": "Test query: Yesterday, I learned an interesting fact about black holes that are capable of distorting time. Please store this memory.",
  "maximum_reasoning_steps": 10,
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Initiate reasoning steps, and when finished, please set terminate_network_traversal to true and output_result to the result of the input_query and return this entire json object as your response: output_result. Note: place your first response/query/etc. in the <FILL THIS IN> field below. You will refer to yourself as this assistant in this reasoning_steps field."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "<FILL THIS IN>"
    }
  ],
  "terminate_network_traversal": "false",
  "output_result": "null"
}
```

Once you fill in the context_shard, a memoryless version of me will follow the instructions to assess the importance of the newly shared fact and determine whether to store the information as a memory shard.

### TEST STORE SHARD
