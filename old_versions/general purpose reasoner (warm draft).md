Next, we'll draft a new document titled "You Need More Than Attention," which will explore the parallels between electronic components and AI concepts. The document will discuss how transistors are like neural networks, logic gates are like transformers, I/O circuits are like chatbots, and computers are like primitive AGIs. We'll also provide a comprehensive description of how this analogy relates to the Turing Machine as a general logic computer. Here's a brief outline to get started:

**You Need More Than Attention**
