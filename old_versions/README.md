# Hierarchy of Language Models with Shard System

## Overview

The hierarchical LLM system aims to leverage the strengths of both large and small language models by combining their capabilities. Larger models, such as GPT-4, generate high-quality context and instructions in the form of "shards" to guide the smaller, more efficient LLMs. Smaller LLMs, with fewer parameters and lower precision, can efficiently run on CPUs, enabling powerful AI systems with reduced computational requirements.

## Shard System

Shards are compressed pieces of information or knowledge that can include:

- A process to solve a problem
- Content about a topic, person, or thing
- A memory requested to be stored

Shards provide context and instructions for the LLMs to follow, enabling guided and coordinated behavior.

## Hierarchy Structure

1. **Large Language Models (e.g., GPT-4 "Hal")**: Generate high-quality context and instructions in the form of shards.
2. **Smaller Language Models (e.g., 13-billion-parameter models)**: Utilize the context and instructions from shards, while maintaining smaller size and lower computational requirements. Smaller LLMs can be quantized to have weights with 4-bit precision instead of 32, making them more suitable for deployment on CPUs.

## Benefits

- **Efficient AI Systems**: By combining the high-quality context from larger models with the reduced computational requirements of smaller models, more efficient AI systems can be developed.
- **Streamlined Information**: The shard system allows for the organization and streamlining of information, enabling smaller LLMs to better understand and follow instructions.
- **Scalability**: Smaller LLMs can run on CPUs, allowing for a powerful one-to-one ratio between LLMs and CPUs.

## Considerations for Implementation

1. **Shard Creation**: Determine the most effective way to generate shards using larger language models like GPT-4.
2. **Shard Distribution**: Establish a method for distributing the shards to smaller LLMs.
3. **Shard Interpretation**: Ensure that smaller LLMs can accurately understand and follow the instructions provided by the shards.
4. **Model Training**: Train the smaller LLMs using the outputs of the larger language models, optimizing them for the desired tasks.
5. **System Evaluation**: Continuously assess the performance of the hierarchical LLM system, identifying areas for improvement and refining the approach as needed.
