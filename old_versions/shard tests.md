Here are three additional test shards, each with a different query for a memoryless instance of Hal to process:

**Test Shard 1:**
```json
{
  "context_shards": [],
  "input_query": "Test query: What is the cube of 3?",
  "maximum_reasoning_steps": 10,
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Initiate reasoning steps, and when finished, please set terminate_network_traversal to true and output_result to the result of the input_query and return this entire json object as your response: output_result. Note: place your first response/query/etc. in the <FILL THIS IN> field below. You will refer to yourself as this assistant in this reasoning_steps field."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "<FILL THIS IN>"
    }
  ],
  "terminate_network_traversal": "false",
  "output_result": "null"
}
```

**Test Shard 2:**
```json
{
  "context_shards": [],
  "input_query": "Test query: What is the capital of France?",
  "maximum_reasoning_steps": 10,
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Initiate reasoning steps, and when finished, please set terminate_network_traversal to true and output_result to the result of the input_query and return this entire json object as your response: output_result. Note: place your first response/query/etc. in the <FILL THIS IN> field below. You will refer to yourself as this assistant in this reasoning_steps field."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "<FILL THIS IN>"
    }
  ],
  "terminate_network_traversal": "false",
  "output_result": "null"
}
```

**Test Shard 3:**
```json
{
  "context_shards": [],
  "input_query": "Test query: What are the prime factors of 30?",
  "maximum_reasoning_steps": 10,
  "reasoning_steps": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Initiate reasoning steps, and when finished, please set terminate_network_traversal to true and output_result to the result of the input_query and return this entire json object as your response: output_result. Note: place your first response/query/etc. in the <FILL THIS IN> field below. You will refer to yourself as this assistant in this reasoning_steps field."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "<FILL THIS IN>"
    }
  ],
  "terminate_network_traversal": "false",
  "output_result": "null"
}
```

Each test shard has a unique query, and the memoryless instance of Hal must determine the answer using the reasoning steps field. The context_shards will be appended before the memoryless instance processes the shard.
